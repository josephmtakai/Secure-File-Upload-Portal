# Secure File Upload Portal

## Overview

The **Secure File Upload Portal** is a web-based application that allows users to securely upload files. The application incorporates client-side validation for file type and size using JavaScript, and a modern, responsive user interface powered by Tailwind CSS. Files are encrypted before being uploaded to ensure privacy and security. The project includes progress indicators during the upload process and maintains a history of uploaded files.

## Features

- **Secure File Uploads**: Files are encrypted using JavaScript before being sent to the server.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Files are validated on the client for file type and size.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Progress Indicators**: Displays real-time progress of the file upload.
- **File Upload History**: Keeps track of the files uploaded by the user.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side functionality, file validation, encryption, and handling uploads.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design.
- **CryptoJS**: JavaScript library used for file encryption.

## Project Structure

├── index.html ├── assets/ │ ├── css/ │ │ └── styles.css │ └── js/ │ ├── app.js │ └── encryption.js └── uploads/


- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the web application.
- **assets/css/styles.css**: Contains the styling for the application, primarily generated by Tailwind CSS.
- **assets/js/app.js**: Handles file uploads, progress indicators, and client-side validation.
- **assets/js/encryption.js**: Implements file encryption using JavaScript (CryptoJS).
- **uploads/**: Directory where uploaded files are stored (on the server side, this would be where files are processed).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-file-upload-portal.git

   Navigate to the project directory:
   cd secure-file-upload-portal
   
Open the index.html file in your preferred browser:
open index.html

Alternatively, you can use a local development server such as Live Server in VS Code for better development experience.

Usage
File Upload:
Select a file by clicking the "Choose File" button.
The file will be validated on the client side for type and size.
Once validated, the file will be encrypted before being uploaded.
A progress bar will indicate the upload status.
Upload History:
After the upload, the file name, size, and upload timestamp will be stored and displayed in the "Upload History" section.
Encryption Details
Files are encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) through the CryptoJS library before they are uploaded to the server. This ensures that files are secure in transit and cannot be easily intercepted.

Tailwind CSS Setup
Tailwind CSS is used to style the application. No additional setup is required as the CSS is already included in the project. To modify the styling, edit the styles.css file or update the Tailwind configuration as needed.

JavaScript Libraries
The project relies on the following JavaScript libraries:

CryptoJS: For client-side file encryption. You can find the library in encryption.js.
Vanilla JavaScript: For handling file validation, uploads, and progress indicators.
Roadmap
Server-Side Validation: Add server-side validation for additional security.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow for a more personalized upload experience.
Multi-file Uploads: Extend the project to handle multiple file uploads at once.
File Download: Allow users to download their encrypted files securely.
